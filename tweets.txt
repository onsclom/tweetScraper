tweet: 95% Approval Rating in the Republican Party, a Record! 53% overall (plus add 9 points?). Corrupt Democrat politicians have brought me to highest polling numbers ever with the Impeachment Hoax. Thank you Nancy!

tweet: The Radical Left, Do Nothing Democrats, don‚Äôt want justice when pushing the Impeachment Hoax, they only want to destabilize the Republican Party so they can do better in the 2020 election, &amp; that includes the House &amp; Senate. They are playing with the people by taking it this far!

tweet: .....So, what the hell has happened to @FoxNews. Only I know! Chris Wallace and others should be on Fake News CNN or MSDNC. How‚Äôs Shep Smith doing? Watch, this will be the beginning of the end for Fox, just like the other two which are dying in the ratings. Social Media is great!
tweet: Really pathetic how @FoxNews is trying to be so politically correct by loading the airwaves with Democrats like Chris Van Hollen, the no name Senator from Maryland. He has been on forever playing up the Impeachment Hoax. Dems wouldn‚Äôt even give Fox their low ratings debates....

tweet: Schiff must release the IG report, without changes or tampering, which is said to be yet further exoneration of the Impeachment Hoax. He refuses to give it. Does it link him to Whistleblower? Why is he so adamant?
tweet: READ THE TRANSCRIPTS!
tweet: The Democrat controlled House never even asked John Bolton to testify. It is up to them, not up to the Senate!
tweet: ...(Democrats said I never met) and released the military aid to Ukraine without any conditions or investigations - and far ahead of schedule. I also allowed Ukraine to purchase Javelin anti-tank missiles. My Administration has done far more than the previous Administration.
tweet: ...transcripts of my calls with President Zelensky are all the proof that is needed, in addition to the fact that President Zelensky &amp; the Foreign Minister of Ukraine said there was no pressure and no problems. Additionally, I met with President Zelensky at the United Nations...
tweet: I NEVER told John Bolton that the aid to Ukraine was tied to investigations into Democrats, including the Bidens. In fact, he never complained about this at the time of his very public termination. If John Bolton said this, it was only to sell a book. With that being said, the...

tweet: Sleepyeyes Chuck Todd of Meet the Corrupt Press, just had a ‚Äútotally‚Äù softball interview with conman Adam Schiff, never even calling Shifty out on his fraudulent statement to Congress, where he made up ALL of the words of my conversation with the Ukrainian President! FAKE NEWS
tweet: After having been exposed as a fraud and corrupt, can anyone, including Sleepyeyes Chuck Todd of Fake @NBCNews, continue to listen to his con?
tweet: ‚ÄúAgain: Read the Transcript!‚Äù Michael Goodwin, New York Post, Sunday.
tweet: Great Editorial in today‚Äôs Wall Street Journal, ‚ÄúAnd Congress Shall Be King.‚Äù Bottom line: ‚ÄúThe President becomes a vassal of King Congress. This is another reason for the Senate to repudiate this House Impeachment as its own abuse of power.‚Äù A partisan Hoax!

tweet: The Impeachment Hoax is a massive election interference the likes of which has never been seen before. In just two hours the Radical Left, Do Nothing Democrats have seen their phony case absolutely shredded. Shifty is now exposed for illegally making up my phone call, &amp; more!
